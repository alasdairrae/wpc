## There is one file in here for each constituency. You'll notice the file names begin with the name of the constituency.

Look closely at each file name and you'll see it includes a few bits of useful information:

New_Forest_East_(England)_Conservative_21995_majority_2017_declared_213_out_of_650.png

File name format is as follows: constituency then the country, then the winning party at the last vote, their majority and then when the result was declared at the 2017 general election.

I hope you find these useful.
