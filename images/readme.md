## There is one file for each constituency. You'll notice the file names begin with the name of the constituency.

In order to make it easier to flick between images and find what you're looking for, I've put all of them on Google Drive in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xPneIJtI4xWQhJ8TrxsCGHjGRcqCybKa_DELETE_THIS_TO_MAKE_IT_LIVE). Look closely at each file name and you'll see it includes a few bits of useful information:

*New_Forest_East_(England)_Conservative_21995_majority_2017_declared_213_out_of_650.png*

File name format is as follows: constituency then the country, then the winning party at the last vote, their majority and then when the result was declared at the 2017 general election.

**On each constituency card, the constituency named at the top of the images is displayed in the centre of the map frame and surrounding areas are dimmed. Place labels are shown for a selection of places within each constituency, plus any cities nearby. I have also added builting footprints to the maps so you can see the underlying settlement pattern.**

I hope you find these useful. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
