# Constituency Cards

**An open data project involving official MP portraits, electoral data, population data, geodata and a few other bits and bobs.**

This is a spare time project that I'd been meaning to put together for a while, but hadn't got round to. My intention was to put together a set of 'constituency cards' - one for each Westminster constituency - that provided some basic information on each area, its MP and the last general election (or by-election). My real goal was to see if it was possible to bring together multiple open data sources, including the new official MP portraits, and create some useful information out of it. The files in the **images folder** are the result

The files in the [images folder](https://github.com/alasdairrae/wpc/tree/master/images) are the result. 

## Sources
The MP photos were mostly sourced from the official portraits that were published by the Parlimanetary Digital Service [which you can find on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Official_United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_photographs_2017).
