# Constituency Cards
## A little open data project involving official MP portraits, electoral data, population data, geodata and a few other bits and bobs.

Coming soon, I promise.

## Sources
The MP photos were mostly sourced from the official portraits that were published by the Parlimanetary Digital Service [which you can find on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Official_United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_photographs_2017).
