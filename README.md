# Constituency Cards

**An open data project involving official MP portraits, electoral data, population data, geodata and a few other bits and bobs.**

This is a spare time project that I'd been meaning to put together for a while, but hadn't got round to. But with a general election potentially looming, I thought I'd try to get it done. My intention was to put together a set of 'constituency cards' - one for each Westminster constituency - that provided some basic information on each area, its MP and the last general election (or by-election). My real goal was to see if it was possible to bring together multiple open data sources, including the new official MP portraits, and create some useful information out of it. The files in the [images folder](https://github.com/alasdairrae/wpc/tree/master/images) are the result. The intention is that they are used as a set of cards to be viewed on screen - that's why they're sized using a 16:9 ratio.

If you want to read more about this little project, including data, software, styling and all that, then head over to [my blog post on it](https://github.com/alasdairrae/wpc/tree/master/images), where I have explained it all in detail. But remember, I have not done this in any official capacity - it's really just an open data experiment to see how much useful information I could extract from a mix of raw data sources.

## Sources
The MP photos were mostly sourced from the official portraits that were published by the Parlimanetary Digital Service [which you can find on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Official_United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_photographs_2017). These photos were released under a Creative Commons licence and their existence is one of the main motivations for me doing this - I think they're great and wanted to find a project I could integrate them into.

The underlying electoral data comes from the [House of Commons Library](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7979) - at the bottom of the linked page -
