## Files I used to make the constituency cards

**UPDATE 04 December 2019:** the most up to date file is the Excel file above (wpc_2019_flat_file_v9.8_04_dec_2019.xlsx). I have also added a clean constituency shapefile without data that you can join this to (uk_wpc_2019_without_data_v9.zip). Not long after I began this little side project, lots of party affiliations changed but I have left the original (v7) files above for reference. Thanks again to Philip Brown for helping with this. The most recent file includes mid-2018 population estimates for constituencies (total population, plus age groups of 18-24, 25-49, 50-64 and 65 plus) as well as EU referendum results/estimates for all UK constituencies. Where the exact figures are not known, they are based on [Chris Hanretty's constituency estimates](https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/final-estimates-of-the-leave-vote-or-areal-interpolation-and-the-uks-referendum-on-eu-membership-5490b6cab878).

The geo files I've shared here are the constituency files for the whole UK with all the underlying data attached (based on the original spreadsheet, before all the party changes- use the latest spreadsheet above for the latest data). I've shared it in Shapefle, geojson and GeoPackage format. The original data I sourced from ONS and Ordnance Survey (as it says on the final outputs) but I noticed a lot of the previous mapping didn't show Northern Ireland's large loughs so I fixed that and chopped them out. It just didn't seem right looking at Northern Ireland completely filled in. These files are quite big so if you are using then on the web you might want to try a generalised version instead (which you can easily create using Mapshaper).

I've also shared a simple csv file, without any geodata attached.

## Sources and licencing
The MP photos were mostly sourced from the official portraits that were published by the Parlimanetary Digital Service [which you can find on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Official_United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_photographs_2017). These photos were released under a Creative Commons licence and their existence is one of the main motivations for me doing this - I think they're great and wanted to find a project I could integrate them into. The official MP portraits, unfortunately, only cover about 90% of MPs, but I didn't want to miss anyone out so I extracted the rest from public sources, including Wikipedia and Twitter. I think having the MP portraits adds a lot to the images and helps humanise them.

The underlying electoral data comes from the [House of Commons Library](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7979) - at the bottom of the linked page - and also from  [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/wehelpyou/see-a-list-of-every-mp-in-parliament/) who, by the way, do amazing work more generally. Data produced by the House of Commons are also open, and available under the [Open Parliament Licence](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/copyright-parliament/open-parliament-licence/). The underlying GIS data comes from [ONS](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) and [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html). The information on distance to Parliament and area of each constituency are figures I calculated myself in QGIS. 

For the colours, these are mostly the same as the ones the BBC use. However, for Independent MPs (who I have found difficult to keep track of, sorry!), I have used a pinkish colour that others have adopted, and for the Speaker I used the blue from the [Parliamentary Digital Service blog](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/). Thanks to Philip Brown at the University of Sheffield for helping with all this.
