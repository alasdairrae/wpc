# Files I used to make the constituency cards

**UPDATE 22 November 2019:** the most up to date file is the Excel file above (wpc_2019_flat_file_v9.7_22_nov_2019.xlsx). Not long after I began this little side project, lots of party affiliations changed but I think I now have a complete, up-to-date file. Thanks again to Philip Brown for helping with this. The most recent file includes mid-2018 population estimates for constituencies (total population, plus age groups of 18-24, 25-49, 50-64 and 65 plus) as well as EU referendum results/estimates for all UK constituencies. Where the exact figures are not known, they are based on [Chris Hanretty's constituency estimates](https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/final-estimates-of-the-leave-vote-or-areal-interpolation-and-the-uks-referendum-on-eu-membership-5490b6cab878).

The geo files I've shared here are the constituency files for the whole UK with all the underlying data attached (based on the original spreadsheet, before all the party changes- use the latest spreadsheet above for the latest data). I've shared it in Shapefle, geojson and GeoPackage format. The original data I sourced from ONS and Ordnance Survey (as it says on the final outputs) but I noticed a lot of the previous mapping didn't show Northern Ireland's large loughs so I fixed that and chopped them out. It just didn't seem right looking at Northern Ireland completely filled in. These files are quite big so if you are using then on the web you might want to try a generalised version instead (which you can easily create using Mapshaper).

I've also shared a simple csv file, without any geodata attached.
